**WIFIRO** is a research hub and collection of tools dedicated to exploring wireless network security. This project aims to centralize methodologies, scripts, and WiFi auditing techniques—ranging from 4-way handshake captures to in-depth vulnerability analysis of encryption protocols—in one organized repository.

## 🚀 Key Focus Areas (WIP)

This project is currently under active development (**Work In Progress**). Our roadmap includes:

* **Handshake Capture:** Automated techniques for capturing WPA/WPA2 4-way handshakes.
* **PMKID Attacks:** Implementation of client-less network auditing techniques.
* **Deauthentication Research:** Analyzing deauth mechanisms for security auditing and stress testing.
* **Protocol Exploration:** Deep dives into WEP, WPA2, and the latest WPA3 security standards.
* **Mitigation & Hardening:** Step-by-step guides on how to defend and secure wireless routers.

## 🛠️ Tools & Methodology

In its development, this project references and integrates industry-standard tools such as:
* **Aircrack-ng Suite:** The industry standard for wireless auditing.
* **Bettercap:** For modern, interactive network analysis.
* **Besside-ng:** For automated mass handshake and IVs capture.
* **Airgorah:** For GUI/CLI-based deauthentication testing.
